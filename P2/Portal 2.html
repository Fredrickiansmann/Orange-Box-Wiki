            <h1>
                Lore of Portal 2
            </h1>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <strong>Portal 2</strong> is the sequel to the hit 2007 first-person puzzle game <a>Portal</a>, being created by Valve and released in 2011. Portal 2 takes place 50 - 50,000 years after the <a>First Game</a>, with our main character Chell, having been in stasis for the previously mentioned amount of time continuing in the Aperture Laboratories, being woken up by the small, charasmatic, mostly rail bound <b>Wheatley</b> - With his and the iconic acquired Portal Gun's help we accidentally reactivate the long shut down GLaDOS, originally defeated in The First Game.
          <h2>Beginning</h2>
          As GLaDOS quickly and efficiently gets the Aperture Laboratory back in working order, we are once again being experimented on her with Wheatley in the shadows, with many more technologies being introduced than shown previously. We also get off course of the experiments and see many of the fascinating facility maintenence facilities, eventually reaching GLaDOS herself with the returning guidence of Wheatley, here, on his Commands, we eject GLaDOS from facility controls, in place we install Wheatley, who instantly has GLaDOS contained in a Potato device. However, the power of the whole facility starts to corrupt with Wheatley. GLaDOS as a Potato reveals Wheatley was specially designed to be as intelligently unintelligent as possible, this enrages Wheatley causing him to say his famous line "I AM NOT A MORON!!!" as he bashes us into a very deep pit.

        </p>
        <h2>
        Betrayal
        </h2>
        <p id="lore"> 
          Now alongside Potato GLaDOS our character falls to one of the deepest darkest and oldest part of the facility while it is heard how terribly Wheatley is mismanaging the facility. However we are no longer in the territories of Aperture Laboratories, but instead now in the ancient Aperture Science Innovators facility, from enviromental informations it is deducted this was the precursor to the above facility and the technologies around certainly indicate so. 
          To attempt to get back to the above lab and prevent destruction we have to pass through the facility in the path of what once where the testing rooms for volunteers, and through the automated announcements we can hear the recordings of Aperture Science Innovators founder & former CEO Cave Johnson, who's voice reminds GLaDOS (Who we bring around with our character while she is in her potato form) of events long in the past, revealing that in the many many years past, she used to be his personal secretary and eventually the inherited position of CEO of aperture science, where her conscious was eventually uploaded into our GLaDOS. 
          We can also, looking around the old facility, in one of the large testing chambers find a dock designated for a large ship named "Borealis", which, is a major plotpoint in Half Life 2 Episode 2, confirming the Valve games here share universes.
        </p>
        <h2>The Part Where He Kills You</h2>
        <p id="lore"> 
          Eventually we make it back to the core facility, where it is obvious Wheatley has completely fried the place, now having renamed Aperture Laboratories to Wheatley Laboratories, soon Wheatley is the one now testing us in the collapsing facility as he gets addicted to it. Though eventually he gets tired of testing the unruly player, for he found "two little robots back here, Built specifically for testin'!", so comes <i>"The Part Where He Kills You"</i>, or atleast where he tries to. Eventually we, alongside GLaDOS, make it to Wheatley personally, where he attacks us with bombs and the classic neurotoxins, with which (similiarly to the first game) we use to disable wheatley alongside many personality cores. But the button we would have used to replace him was boobytrapped in a twist, and as the facility is collapsing around the room the night sky is revealed to us for the first time, with the moon glowing above.
          The player casts an end portal to the moon rock, which is usefully the only material that can hold Portal Gun Portals, and we and Wheatley are briefly sucked into space until a large mechanical arm of GLaDOS saves us, and leaves Wheatley.
          </p>
          <h2>The End</h2>
        <p id="lore"> 
          In the end GLaDOS fully reconciles with the player, even calling us "Her Best Friend" - Or atleast that was the "Caroline" part of GLaDOS, which she swiftly deletes, however she still lets us go, "It's been fun, Don't come back", up an elevator, past a choir of Turret we are allowed up and out a bunker hatch to the sunny surface, with the door closing behind us - Before opening again to also kick out a scarred Companion cube.
          The Iconic song of the game <i>"Now I only want you gone"</i> plays preceding the proper Credits, concluding truly one of, if not The Most iconic games of the 2010s Decade.

<h1>Portal 2 Co-op</h1>
<p id="coop">
  Portal is the first Portal game to include a multiplayer, integrated into the lore as GLaDOS having found a replacement for Human test subjects in Robot test subjects, with these two little robots being Atlas & P-Body in their respective Blue & Orange.
  They are infinitely replacable human sized test robots, and they are each equipped a Portal gun each shooting one of the original two Portal colours alongside a new twin Portal.
