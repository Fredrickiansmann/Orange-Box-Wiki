            <h1>
                Significance
            </h1>
          Created in 1998 by the then, small company, Valve, <strong>Half Life</strong> is truly one of the <b>most significant games of all time</b> in the most literal manner, shaping the form of all the most popular games of the modern age. 
          It's pioneership in NPC AI, storytelling, Weapons Gameplay, Graphics and many more items where unmatched in it's time, most of all in the then newly made <i>GoldSrc Engine</i>, a heavily modified rendiiton of the Quake Engine, Powering some of the most well known computer games of the early 2000s such as the original Counter Strike, Team fortress Classic, Cry of Fear, Team Fortress, and ofcourse <b>xHalf Life</b> (And it's expansions).
          Even the hit 2004 sequal to the game, <a><b>Half Life 2</b></a>, continued it's legacy in pioneership with the Source Engine, which is even in modern times one of the most influential engines.

            <h1>
                Lore of Half Life
            </h1>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          Our silent protagonist we follow throughout the game is 28 year old <b>Gordon Freeman</b>, research associate at the Black Mesa Research Facility working in Anomalous Materials with a Ph.D in theoretical Physics.
          The Black Mesa facility is spawnling Goverment backed underground research facility located in the most remote end of New Mexico, it deals much in items not meant for public knowledges.
          <h2>Beginning</h2>
          <b>Half Life</b> starts with Gordon Freeman coming in late to work, being told to hurry as he puts on his signature orange HEV (Hazardous Enviromental) Suit, towards the lab we can spot a mysterious Government man with a briefcase through the window Chatting with a Co-worker. 
          As we reach the testing sight where Freeman is due, we are briefed on the task at hand, being told of some risks due to some rushes in experiment preperations, However the experiment is still a go, and Freeman is put in the chamber to push this odd Orange Crystal into an Anti-Mass Spectrometer.
          <h2>Disaster</h2>
          The result of this pushing of the crystal into the Anti-Mass Spectrometer, known infamously inuniverse and out as the <b>Resonance Cascade</b>, is a complete disaster as Freeman for a brief period is shifted across realms, seeing the oddest of entities. Once back on Earth however, the facility is in complete dissarray, 'rifts' have opened up and now odd Alien creatures are crawling about the lab terrorizing and killing many scientists and even armed security guards in the process.
          Gordon Freeman, starting with his signature crowbar, makes his way through the terrible raids of Aliens, with destruction all around. On his way to escape from the surface Freeman, awaiting their arrival like everyone else in the facility, notices the Military in the HECU (Hazardous Enviroment combat Unit) being deployed,
          however, unlike what is hoped they haven't come there to save the Black Mesa staff, it is observed as scientists gleeful at savior from these military men are gunned down.
          <h2>Invasion</h2>
          At the surface the grander scale of the disaster can be seen, with odd flying ray creatures destroying even the most advanced of military equipments.
          Surviving Scientists from the Lambda lab section of Black Mesa make proper contact with Freeman, guiding him to Launch a rocket of theirs carrying a satellite which they theorize might help in closing the Alien Rift, Freeman successfully completes the launch, however the effect of the rift closing is not exactly immediate.
          The Alien invasion to the facility continues and grows, and as the HECU is decimated and evacuating, a new Government foe appears in the Black Ops, tasked with killing <b>All</b> witnesses of the event, including the Government Militarymen, attemping to prepare a mass air strike at the location to cover everything up.
          However Gordon in the immediate alone halts their plans, he makes his way back down deeper into the Black Mesa facility to reach the Lambda Lab scientists who have been contacting him. Eventually, guided by the help of other survivors he makes it, and the scientists reveal a teleporter they would like to use to shut down the rift from the source. 
          It is a desperate effort for Gordon is the last man they could send after all the other's had failed, and so, in chaos, Gordon enters the Alien World.
        <h2>Xen</h2>
        In this new Alien World of <i>"Xen"</i> Gordon finds himself in an archipelago of odd floating islands in a void, scattered about these are odd fauna and remains of the previously sent by the scientists teleportation subjects preceding Gordon.
        Leaping across these many realms of Xen Islands, going through the very home factories of where all the terrorizing Aliens have been coming from, Gordon finally goes through the rift leading to the seemingly Alien leader, the Nihilanth, who so far has been communicating through psycic means with Gordon,
        however despite the Nihilanth's mockings, Gordon persists and finally blows it up, seemingly closing the Alien rifts attacking Black Mesa on Earth.

        </p>
          <h2>The End</h2>
        <p id="lore"> 
          However, it all seemingly stops, and then Gordon Freeman is put infront of the strange <b>Government Man</b> in an even stranger surrounding void.
          The <b>'Government Man'</b> congratulates Gordon in surviving all the previous events, so impressed infact he has recommended Freeman's services to his "employers", seeing Freeman with "Limitless Potential". 
          Ultimately, the 'Government Man', or the Gman, gives Gordon a final decision, having him put in a Metro in the middle of a void. If Freeman is interested in the Gman's job offer he ought then step right into the bright Green rift portal now shining at the Metro cab exit, otherwise, if not, He could "offer you a battle you have no chance of winning". 
          Stepping into the rift, Freeman is told he will be seen "Up ahead", with, in quotes and tune;
