Portal is a first-person puzzle-platform video game that was both developed and published by <a href="">Valve Corporation</a>. It made its debut on October 10, 2007, as part of the game collection known as The Orange Box for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360, followed by a subsequent release for PlayStation 3. In Portal, players take on the role of Chell, a mute protagonist tasked with navigating a series of test chambers located within the enigmatic Aperture Science Enrichment Center. This is accomplished using the "Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device," commonly referred to as a portal gun, which generates interconnected spatial portals on flat surfaces. The game artfully blends physics-based puzzles, platforming elements, and dark humor, prominently featuring the renowned artificial intelligence character GLaDOS, whose guidance and malevolent undertones propel the storyline. Portal received widespread acclaim for its groundbreaking gameplay mechanics, distinctive narrative, and minimalist aesthetic, rapidly achieving both critical and commercial success, thereby solidifying its status as a pivotal work in the realm of video game design.
